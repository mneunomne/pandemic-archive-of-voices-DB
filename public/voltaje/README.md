VirtualSky
==========

A browser-based planetarium that can be [customized and embedded in web pages](http://lcogt.net/virtualsky/embed/custom.html). View as [full-window](http://slowe.github.io/VirtualSky/embed?projection=stereo). Some [examples with code excerpts](http://slowe.github.io/VirtualSky/) and some [unit tests](http://slowe.github.io/VirtualSky/tests).

It is provided as is. Do not expect support.

This project was made more than a decade ago because nothing quite like it existed on the web. Since then, plenty of other projects have been created. For instance, [Stellarium Web Engine](https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium-web-engine) now exists and uses WebGL (which wasn't really a thing in 2010). Check if that is more suitable for your needs.

Stuart Lowe initially developed this at [Las Cumbres Observatory](https://lco.global/) (LCO is a private operating foundation, building a global network of telescopes for professional research and citizen investigations) between 2010-3. After leaving LCO in 2013, he maintained this in his spare time for several years.
